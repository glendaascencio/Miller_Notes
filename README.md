**Miller** (commonly abbreviated as mlr) is a powerful command-line tool that is used for handling, transforming, and analyzing structured data such as CSV, TSV, JSON, and other text-based data formats. It combines the functionality of tools like awk, sed, cut, and jq for easy manipulation of tabular data, but with more capabilities and simpler syntax.

Here’s a guide to get you started with Miller, along with examples of commonly used commands to manipulate data.

1. Installing Miller
You can install Miller using a package manager like brew, apt, or you can download it from its official GitHub repository.

For macOS (using Homebrew):

bash
Copy code
brew install miller
For Ubuntu/Debian (via APT):

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install miller
Alternatively, you can download and install Miller from its GitHub repository.

2. Basic Operations with CSV Data
Let’s start with some CSV data. Assume you have the following data.csv file:

csv
Copy code
name,age,department,salary
Alice,30,Engineering,60000
Bob,35,Marketing,55000
Charlie,25,Engineering,50000
Diana,40,HR,62000
Eve,45,Marketing,70000
a. Viewing CSV Data
To quickly view the contents of a CSV file using Miller, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
mlr --icsv cat data.csv
Here:

--icsv specifies that the input is in CSV format.
cat is the basic Miller operation to print the file contents.
Output:
Copy code
name     age  department   salary
Alice    30   Engineering  60000
Bob      35   Marketing    55000
Charlie  25   Engineering  50000
Diana    40   HR           62000
Eve      45   Marketing    70000
b. Selecting Specific Columns
If you only want to view specific columns, you can use cut to select them:

bash
Copy code
mlr --icsv cut -f name,salary data.csv
Here:

cut -f name,salary tells Miller to only display the name and salary fields.
Output:
Copy code
name     salary
Alice    60000
Bob      55000
Charlie  50000
Diana    62000
Eve      70000
c. Filtering Rows
To filter rows based on a condition, you can use the filter operation. For example, to show only rows where the salary is greater than 60000:

bash
Copy code
mlr --icsv filter '$salary > 60000' data.csv
Here:

$salary refers to the salary field.
The condition > 60000 filters rows where the salary exceeds 60000.
Output:
Copy code
name     age  department  salary
Diana    40   HR          62000
Eve      45   Marketing   70000
d. Sorting Data
To sort the data by a specific column (e.g., by age), you can use the sort operation:

bash
Copy code
mlr --icsv sort -n age data.csv
Here:

sort -n age tells Miller to sort the file by the age column numerically.
Output:
Copy code
name     age  department   salary
Charlie  25   Engineering  50000
Alice    30   Engineering  60000
Bob      35   Marketing    55000
Diana    40   HR           62000
Eve      45   Marketing    70000
e. Calculating Statistics
You can use the stats1 command to calculate statistics such as sum, average, min, max, etc. For example, to compute the average salary:

bash
Copy code
mlr --icsv stats1 -a mean -f salary data.csv
Here:

stats1 computes statistics for one or more fields.
-a mean specifies that we want the mean (average).
-f salary specifies the field to apply the statistics to.
Output:
Copy code
mean_salary
59400
3. Transforming Data
Miller is especially powerful when transforming data formats or values. Here are a few examples:

a. Converting CSV to JSON
You can easily convert a CSV file to JSON format:

bash
Copy code
mlr --icsv --ojson cat data.csv
Here:

--ojson specifies that the output should be in JSON format.
Output:
json
Copy code
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 30,
  "department": "Engineering",
  "salary": 60000
}
{
  "name": "Bob",
  "age": 35,
  "department": "Marketing",
  "salary": 55000
}
{
  "name": "Charlie",
  "age": 25,
  "department": "Engineering",
  "salary": 50000
}
{
  "name": "Diana",
  "age": 40,
  "department": "HR",
  "salary": 62000
}
{
  "name": "Eve",
  "age": 45,
  "department": "Marketing",
  "salary": 70000
}
b. Renaming Columns
If you want to rename columns in your data, use the rename operation. For example, renaming name to full_name and salary to income:

bash
Copy code
mlr --icsv rename name,full_name,salary,income data.csv
Output:
Copy code
full_name  age  department   income
Alice      30   Engineering  60000
Bob        35   Marketing    55000
Charlie    25   Engineering  50000
Diana      40   HR           62000
Eve        45   Marketing    70000
c. Updating or Creating New Fields
To update a field or create a new one, you can use the put operation. For example, let’s create a new field called bonus where each person gets 10% of their salary:

bash
Copy code
mlr --icsv put '$bonus = $salary * 0.10' data.csv
Output:
yaml
Copy code
name     age  department   salary  bonus
Alice    30   Engineering  60000   6000
Bob      35   Marketing    55000   5500
Charlie  25   Engineering  50000   5000
Diana    40   HR           62000   6200
Eve      45   Marketing    70000   7000
d. Joining Datasets
Miller allows you to join two datasets. Suppose you have another file departments.csv:

csv
Copy code
department,location
Engineering,Building A
Marketing,Building B
HR,Building C
You can join this dataset with the main data based on the department field:

bash
Copy code
mlr --icsv join --uheader --lp data --rp dept -j department -f data.csv -f departments.csv
Here:

join -j department tells Miller to join the two files on the department column.
-lp and -rp are optional flags that give prefix names to overlapping columns.
Output:
css
Copy code
name     age  data_department  salary  dept_location
Alice    30   Engineering      60000   Building A
Bob      35   Marketing        55000   Building B
Charlie  25   Engineering      50000   Building A
Diana    40   HR               62000   Building C
Eve      45   Marketing        70000   Building B
